Kestrel connects directly to your cloud accounts to provide real-time resource inventory, security posture monitoring, and automated incident detection and response.

## Supported Cloud Providers

| Provider | Status | Features |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **AWS** | Generally Available | Resource inventory, security monitoring, VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail analysis |
| **OCI** | Generally Available | Resource inventory, security monitoring, VCN Flow Logs |
| **GCP** | Coming Soon |  - |
| **Azure** | Coming Soon |  - |

## What Cloud Integrations Provide

### Resource Inventory
Kestrel automatically discovers and catalogs your cloud resources - EC2 instances, S3 buckets, RDS databases, VPCs, security groups, IAM roles, and more. This inventory is continuously updated and used by the AI copilot to answer questions about your infrastructure.

### Security Monitoring
Kestrel monitors your cloud resources for security misconfigurations and compliance violations. When an issue is detected, it creates an incident with full root cause analysis and AI-generated remediation.

### VPC/VCN Flow Logs
For network-level visibility, Kestrel can enable and analyze VPC Flow Logs (AWS) or VCN Flow Logs (OCI) to detect suspicious traffic patterns, unauthorized access attempts, and network misconfigurations.

### IaC Remediation
When Kestrel detects a cloud misconfiguration and you have IaC repositories connected via the [CI/CD integration](/integrations/cicd), it can generate a Terraform fix targeting the exact file and resource in your repository, and open a pull request or merge request with the change.

## Prerequisites

- **Organization Admin** role in Kestrel is required to configure cloud integrations
- Access credentials for the cloud account you want to connect

## Next Steps

- [Connect an AWS Account](/cloud/aws)
- [Connect an OCI Tenancy](/cloud/oci)
