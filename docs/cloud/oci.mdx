# OCI Integration

Connect your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) tenancies to Kestrel for cloud resource inventory, security monitoring, and VCN Flow Log analysis.

## Prerequisites

- **Organization Admin** role in Kestrel
- OCI tenancy with permissions to create API keys and policies
- Access to the OCI Console or OCI CLI

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create an API Key

1. In the OCI Console, navigate to **Identity → Users → Your User → API Keys**
2. Click **Add API Key**
3. Download the private key file
4. Note the **fingerprint** displayed after adding the key

### Step 2: Create a Policy (Optional but Recommended)

Create an OCI policy to grant Kestrel read access to your tenancy resources:

```
Allow group KestrelGroup to read all-resources in tenancy
Allow group KestrelGroup to manage vcn in tenancy
Allow group KestrelGroup to manage flow-log-configs in tenancy
```

### Step 3: Connect in Kestrel

1. Navigate to **Integrations → Cloud** in your Kestrel dashboard
2. Click **Connect OCI Tenancy**
3. Fill in the connection form:
   - **Connection Name**: A friendly name for this tenancy (e.g., "Production")
   - **Tenancy OCID**: Your tenancy OCID (found in OCI Console → Tenancy Details)
   - **User OCID**: Your user OCID (found in OCI Console → User Settings)
   - **Fingerprint**: The API key fingerprint from Step 1
   - **Private Key**: Paste the contents of the private key PEM file
   - **Region**: Select your OCI home region
4. Click **Verify & Connect**

Kestrel will validate the credentials and begin discovering your cloud resources.

## VCN Flow Logs

After connecting an OCI tenancy:

1. Navigate to the connected tenancy in the Cloud Integrations page
2. Expand the **VCN Flow Logs** section
3. Click **Enable** to start collecting flow logs across your VCNs
4. Kestrel creates the necessary log groups and flow log configurations

You can view per-VCN status and manage flow logs individually.

## Managing Connections

- **Refresh**: Re-sync connection status and resource inventory
- **Delete**: Remove the connection from Kestrel. You should also clean up the API key and policy in OCI separately.
