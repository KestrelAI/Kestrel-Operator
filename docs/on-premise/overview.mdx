# On-Premise & Air-Gapped Deployment

For organizations with strict data residency requirements, regulatory compliance needs, or air-gapped environments, Kestrel supports full self-hosted deployment in your own cloud infrastructure.

## Deployment Models

### Standard On-Premise

Deploy Kestrel in your own AWS, GCP, or Azure environment with outbound internet access for LLM API calls and container image pulls.

- All data stays within your environment
- Uses cloud-native LLM services (Amazon Bedrock, Vertex AI, Azure OpenAI)
- Container images pulled from Kestrel's private registry
- Integrates with your existing CI/CD via GitHub.com or GitLab.com

### Air-Gapped

Deploy Kestrel in fully isolated environments with no internet access. All external services are accessed via VPC endpoints.

- **No internet access required**
- Amazon Bedrock accessed via VPC endpoint
- Secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, or OCI Secret Management
- Container images pulled from your private ECR/Artifact Registry/ACR
- Integrates with GitHub Enterprise Server for IaC workflows

## Supported Cloud Providers

| Provider | Standard | Air-Gapped |
|----------|----------|------------|
| **AWS** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **GCP** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Azure** | ✅ | ✅ |

## Architecture

The on-premise deployment includes the following components:

- **Kestrel Server** — Core API server and incident engine
- **Kestrel Frontend** — Web dashboard
- **Kestrel Router** — WebSocket and gRPC routing layer
- **Kestrel Agents** — AI agent workers for incident analysis
- **PostgreSQL** — Primary database (can use managed RDS/Cloud SQL/Azure Database)
- **Redis** — Caching and message queue (can use managed ElastiCache/Memorystore)
- **Elasticsearch/OpenSearch** (Optional) — Enhanced search capabilities

All components are deployed via Helm charts in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (v1.24+) in your cloud environment
- `helm` (v3.0+) installed
- Container registry access (ECR, Artifact Registry, or ACR)
- LLM provider configured (Bedrock, Vertex AI, Azure OpenAI, or OpenAI)
- Secrets management service (AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault)
- IAM role or service account with required permissions
- On-Premise license enabled for your Kestrel organization
