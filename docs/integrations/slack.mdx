The Kestrel Slack integration brings incident response directly into your team's chat. Receive real-time notifications when incidents are detected, ask follow-up questions in threads, and use the `/kestrel` command to interact with the AI copilot.

## Prerequisites

- **Organization Admin** role in Kestrel
- Slack workspace admin permissions (to authorize the app)

## Features

Once connected, the Slack integration provides:

### Incident Notifications
When Kestrel detects an incident in your Kubernetes clusters or cloud infrastructure, it posts a notification to your configured Slack channel with:
- Incident summary and severity
- Affected resources
- Root cause analysis
- AI-generated remediation steps
- Direct link to the Kestrel dashboard

### Smart @Mentions
Namespace owners configured in Kestrel are automatically @mentioned when incidents affect their namespaces, ensuring the right people are notified immediately.

### Interactive Q&A
Reply in the incident notification thread to ask follow-up questions. Kestrel's AI responds with context-aware answers about the incident, affected resources, and recommended actions.

### AI Copilot (`/kestrel` Command)
Use the `/kestrel` slash command anywhere in Slack to ask questions about your infrastructure:
- `/kestrel what pods are crashing in production?`
- `/kestrel show me the network policies for the payments namespace`
- `/kestrel what Terraform code manages my S3 buckets?`

### User Mapping
Kestrel automatically syncs your Slack workspace users to Kestrel accounts for accurate @mention routing. You can trigger a manual sync at any time.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Connect Your Workspace

1. Navigate to **Integrations → Slack** in your Kestrel dashboard
2. Click **Connect Slack Workspace**
3. A popup opens with the Slack OAuth authorization page
4. Review the requested permissions and click **Allow**
5. The popup closes and Kestrel shows your workspace as connected

### Step 2: Invite the Bot

Invite the Kestrel bot to the channel where you want to receive incident notifications:

```
/invite @Kestrel
```

<Tip>
We recommend creating a dedicated `#incidents` channel for Kestrel notifications to keep them organized.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Sync Users

Click **Sync Now** on the User Mapping card to sync your Slack users with Kestrel. This enables smart @mentions for namespace owners.

## Disconnecting

To disconnect the Slack integration:

1. Navigate to **Integrations → Slack**
2. Click **Disconnect Slack**
3. Confirm the disconnection

This immediately stops all notifications and removes the bot from your workspace. You can reconnect at any time.
