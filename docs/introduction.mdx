# Welcome to Kestrel AI

Kestrel AI provides comprehensive Kubernetes security through intelligent network policy management, real-time traffic analysis, and AI-powered security recommendations.

## What is Kestrel AI?

Kestrel AI is a Kubernetes security platform that helps you:

- **Monitor** - Real-time visibility into your Kubernetes network traffic and resource configurations
- **Analyze** - AI-powered analysis of network flows to identify security risks and anomalies
- **Protect** - Automated generation and management of network policies and authorization policies
- **Comply** - Ensure compliance with security best practices and regulatory requirements

## Key Components

### Kestrel Operator

The Kestrel Operator is deployed in your Kubernetes cluster and:
- Streams resource metadata and network telemetry to Kestrel Cloud
- Integrates with Cilium for L3/L4 network flow collection
- Integrates with Istio for L7 access log collection
- Manages network and authorization policies with safe-apply mechanisms

### Kestrel Cloud Platform

The cloud platform provides:
- Centralized dashboard for all your clusters
- AI-powered chat interface for security analysis
- Policy recommendation and management
- Audit logs and compliance reporting

## Why Kestrel AI?

- **Zero Trust Security**: Implement least-privilege network policies automatically
- **AI-Powered**: Leverage AI to analyze traffic patterns and generate optimal policies
- **Safe Operations**: Dry-run and approval workflows prevent accidental disruptions
- **Multi-Cluster**: Manage security across all your Kubernetes clusters from one platform
