# Welcome to Kestrel AI

Kestrel AI is an AI-powered platform for Kubernetes security, cloud incident response, and infrastructure management. It provides real-time monitoring, automated root cause analysis, and AI-generated remediation across your entire infrastructure stack.

## What is Kestrel AI?

Kestrel AI helps your team:

- **Monitor** - Real-time visibility into Kubernetes clusters and cloud infrastructure (AWS, OCI)
- **Detect** - Automated incident detection for Kubernetes misconfigurations, cloud security issues, and infrastructure drift
- **Analyze** - AI-powered root cause analysis with full event chain reconstruction
- **Remediate** - AI-generated fixes deployed through GitOps workflows via GitHub or GitLab
- **Respond** - Incident notifications via Slack and PagerDuty with interactive Q&A

## Platform Components

### Kestrel Operator (Kubernetes)
A lightweight agent deployed in your Kubernetes clusters that streams resource metadata and network telemetry to Kestrel. Integrates with Cilium and Istio for deep traffic analysis.

### Cloud Integrations
Connect your AWS accounts and OCI tenancies for cloud resource inventory, security posture monitoring, and automated incident detection.

### AI Copilot
An AI-powered chat interface that answers questions about your infrastructure, generates configuration changes, and creates pull/merge requests directly from the conversation.

### Incident Response
Automated detection and root cause analysis for both Kubernetes and cloud incidents, with notifications via Slack and PagerDuty and AI-generated remediation steps.
