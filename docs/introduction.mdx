---

Kestrel is the AI-native cloud incident response platform that closes the loop from detection to remediation. Kestrel's AI agents identify, explain, and resolve cloud incidents in seconds - delivering exact, production-ready fixes for the most complex infrastructure and application incidents that take hours to debug.

## What is Kestrel AI?

One platform for every cloud incident. Detect, investigate, and fix Cloud and Kubernetes incidents in seconds.

- **Incident Response** - Monitor your Cloud 24/7 to detect incidents, trace root causes, and generate config fixes with auto-remediation or single-click approval
- **AI Chat Copilot** - Ask any Cloud question and investigate complex, multi-dependency incidents in plain English. Get instant answers with ready-to-apply config changes
- **Risk Assessment** - Launch a swarm of specialized AI agents that discover cross-domain security risks and provide exact remediation steps - before they become incidents
- **Cloud Infrastructure Map** - Visualize your entire Cloud infrastructure in a single, unified view with classified traffic overlaid in real time
- **GitOps + IaC Integration** - Integrate with your existing CI/CD pipelines so that every AI-generated fix becomes a pull request. Keep your team in full control
- **Fast Setup** - Single Helm install command for Kubernetes. Agentless cloud integration for the rest of your Cloud

## From Detection to Fix in Seconds

Kestrel delivers exact, production-ready fixes for the most complex infrastructure incidents - from eBPF misconfigurations and CoreDNS resolution failures in Kubernetes to VPC routing conflicts and Kafka broker issues in your cloud.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Production-Ready Fixes** | Not just root cause - exact remediation |
| **Learns Your Environment** | Gets better with every incident |
| **Deep Infrastructure Context** | Understands your entire infra stack |
| **Fine-Tuned Per Customer** | Models optimized to your infrastructure |

## Platform Capabilities

### Agentic Incident Response
Kestrel monitors your cloud infrastructure 24/7 to detect incidents, trace root causes, and generate ready-to-apply config fixes. On-call monitoring, root cause analysis, and ready-to-apply fixes - all automated.

### AI Chat Copilot
Ask any Cloud question in plain English and get instant answers with config changes. No query syntax required - skip the command-line tools and dashboards. Resolve incidents 10x faster and eliminate hours of debugging.

### Autonomous Risk Assessment
Launch a swarm of AI agents that discover vulnerabilities and provide exact remediation steps across network security, IAM, RBAC, privilege escalation, container image security, and more. Multi-agent coordination with exact config fixes and read-only assessments.

### Cloud Infrastructure Map
Get a complete view of your Cloud infrastructure with intelligent application classification and network traffic visualization. Real-time traffic overlay with network security posture recommendations.

### GitOps & IaC Integration
Every AI-generated configuration change comes with a comprehensive review interface. Deploy directly to your clusters, create pull requests to your GitOps repositories, or sync with Terraform, Pulumi, and other IaC tools.

## Integrations

Kestrel connects to your clouds, Kubernetes clusters, observability tools, and code - then fixes cloud infrastructure incidents automatically through cloud APIs, IaC, and GitOps.

| Integration | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| [Kubernetes Operator](/kubernetes/overview) | Cluster monitoring, incident detection, risk assessments |
| [AWS](/cloud/aws) | Cloud resource inventory, security monitoring, VPC Flow Logs |
| [OCI](/cloud/oci) | Oracle Cloud resource inventory and security monitoring |
| [Slack](/integrations/slack) | Incident notifications, interactive Q&A, AI copilot commands |
| [GitHub & GitLab](/integrations/cicd) | GitOps deployments, IaC remediation via pull/merge requests |
| [PagerDuty](/integrations/pagerduty) | On-call alerting with full RCA context and auto-resolution |
| [Tribal Knowledge](/integrations/tribal-knowledge) | Search Slack, Notion, Confluence, Jira, Linear, and Glean during incidents |
| [On-Premise](/on-premise/overview) | Self-hosted deployment for air-gapped and regulated environments |

## Enterprise-Grade Security

Built for enterprises that demand the highest standards of data privacy, security, and compliance.

- **SOC 2 Compliant**  - Enterprise-grade security controls audited by independent third parties
- **Complete Data Isolation** - Your data is never combined with other customers
- **No Cross-Customer Training**  - Reinforcement learning and fine-tuning happens exclusively on your infrastructure
- **Full Control Over Fixes** - Every AI-generated fix requires your explicit approval
- **Read-Only by Default**  - No write access unless you explicitly enable auto-remediation
- **No Sensitive Data Storage** - Raw data is never stored or persisted; secrets are never sent to Kestrel servers

## Getting Started

Get started in seconds. Single Helm install command for Kubernetes. Agentless for all of Cloud.
