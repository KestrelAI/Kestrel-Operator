Get Kestrel AI up and running in your Kubernetes cluster in just a few steps.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Kubernetes cluster (v1.24+)
- `kubectl` configured to access your cluster
- `helm` (v3.0+) installed
- Admin access to create namespaces and deploy operators

### Optional Integrations

For enhanced functionality:
- **Cilium**: For L3/L4 network flow collection
- **Istio**: For L7 traffic analysis and authorization policies

## Step 1: Sign Up for Kestrel AI

1. Visit [platform.usekestrel.ai](https://platform.usekestrel.ai)
2. Create your account
3. Create your first workspace

## Step 2: Onboard Your Cluster

1. Navigate to **Clusters** in the dashboard
2. Click **Add Cluster**
3. Provide a name for your cluster
4. Choose your traffic data source:
   - **Cilium** for L3/L4 flows
   - **Istio** for L7 access logs
   - **None** for basic resource monitoring only

## Step 3: Install the Kestrel Operator

Copy the generated Helm command from the onboarding page and run it:

```bash
helm install kestrel-operator \
  oci://ghcr.io/kestrelai/charts/kestrel-operator \
  --version 0.1.0 \
  --namespace kestrel-ai \
  --create-namespace \
  -f kestrel-ai-operator-values-<your-cluster>.yaml
```

The values file contains your unique cluster credentials and configuration.

## Step 4: Verify Installation

Check that the operator is running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kestrel-ai
```

You should see:
```
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kestrel-operator-xxxxx-xxxxx       1/1     Running   0          1m
```

## Step 5: View Your Cluster

Return to the Kestrel dashboard. Within a few minutes, you should see:
- Your cluster appearing as "Connected"
- Resources being discovered and displayed
- Network traffic flows (if Cilium/Istio is configured)

## What's Next?

Now that your cluster is connected:

- **[Connect Cloud Accounts](/cloud/overview)**  - Add AWS or OCI for cloud monitoring
- **[Set up Slack](/integrations/slack)**  - Get incident notifications in Slack
- **[Connect CI/CD](/integrations/cicd)**  - Enable GitOps deployments via GitHub or GitLab
- **[Configure PagerDuty](/integrations/pagerduty)**  - Route incidents to your on-call team
- **[Add Tribal Knowledge](/integrations/tribal-knowledge)**  - Enhance incidents with historical context
