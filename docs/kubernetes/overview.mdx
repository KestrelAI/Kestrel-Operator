## What is the Kestrel Operator?

The Kestrel Operator is a lightweight Kubernetes agent that connects your clusters to the Kestrel AI platform. It streams Kubernetes resource metadata, events, logs, and network traffic telemetry over mTLS to Kestrel Cloud — enabling 24/7 real-time incident detection without requiring any changes to your existing infrastructure or applications.

## Key Features

### Incident Detection and Response
- **24/7 real-time incident detection** from Kubernetes events, pod logs, node conditions, and network telemetry
- **Event and log ingestion** streamed to Kestrel Cloud for automated root cause analysis
- **API and command execution** on behalf of AI Agents on Kestrel Cloud for investigation and remediation

### Kubernetes Risk Assessments
- **Intelligent AI agent based risk discovery** inside your Kubernetes Cluster
- **Actionable fixes** for all issues found
- **Highlight attack chains** that other tools without Kubernetes context will miss

### Cluster Inventory and Traffic Visibility
- **Real-time flow collection** from Cilium Hubble or Istio service mesh
- **Zero application changes** required
- **Automatic workload discovery** and inventory management
- **Topology map** with highlighted suspicious flows


## Architecture

The Kestrel Operator consists of several key components:

### Stream Client
Maintains a secure gRPC connection to Kestrel Cloud using mTLS authentication. Handles bidirectional streaming for:
- Sending resource metadata, events, logs, and network flows
- Receiving and executing read-only API calls and commands from Kestrel Cloud

### Network Integrations
- **Cilium Integration**: Collects L3/L4 network flows from Hubble Relay
- **Istio Integration**: Receives L7 access logs via Envoy Access Log Service

## Security Model

### Authentication
- **mTLS certificates** for secure communication with Kestrel Cloud
- **JWT tokens** with automatic renewal for service authentication
- **RBAC permissions** scoped to minimum required access

### Data Protection
- **No sensitive data storage** on the operator
- **Encrypted transmission** for all communications
- **Certificate rotation** for ongoing security

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (v1.24+)
- Cluster admin permissions for installation
- Network connectivity to `grpc.platform.usekestrel.ai:443`

### Optional Components
- **Cilium** (for L3/L4 network flow collection)
- **Istio** (for L7 access log collection and authorization policies)
